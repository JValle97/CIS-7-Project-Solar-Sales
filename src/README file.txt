# Travel Planner

## Project Description

This C++ program helps users plan a trip between cities by finding the lowest cost path, shortest path round trip, adjacent cities, and road information. The program uses a graph data structure to represent the distances between cities and algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm to find the lowest cost path and shortest path round trip.

## Programming Approaches

- Graph data structure: The program uses a graph data structure with an adjacency matrix to represent the distances between cities.
- Dijkstra's algorithm: The program uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path round trip for each city.

## How to Use

1. Compile and run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to select an option from the main menu.
3. Depending on your selection, you may be prompted for additional information such as the starting city, ending city, and stopover city.
4. The program will perform calculations and display information based on your input.
5. You can choose to plan another trip or exit the program.
